# Huboo
This repository is part of a project performed for Huboo, an eCommerce fulfilment copmany in Leipzig. 

The basis of the project was to use a computer vision tracking system developed by Saige Analytics to track workers around picking-and-packing hubs in order to monitor the hubs' efficiency.
